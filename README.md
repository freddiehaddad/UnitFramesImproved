## üîß Technical Details

### Taint-Free Design

- Uses **SecureUnitButtonTemplate** for all interactive frames
- Secure attributes for focus clearing (`*type2 = "clearfocus"`)
- No protected function taint issues
- Menu items filtered to avoid taint-causing operations
- Combat detection prevents frame repositioning during encounters
- **Secure hook integration** - Uses `hooksecurefunc` to detect CVar changes from Interface Options without polling

### Saved Variables

- **Per-character positions** - Each character has their own frame layout
- **Position validation** - Out-of-bounds positions automatically reset to defaults
- **Lock state persistence** - Remembers if frames were unlocked (restores on login if not in combat)

### Performance

- Efficient event handling with targeted updates
- Default Blizzard frames completely disabled (unregistered events)
- Optimized debuff sorting and display
- Smooth animations without frame rate impact
- Instant drag response with custom mouse tracking

### Compatibility

- **Target Server**: Ascension's Warcraft Reborn (3.3.5a)
- **OmniCC Support**: Cooldown numbers work automatically if installed
- Replaces default Blizzard unit frames completely

## Known Issues

- Reset Instances menu option shows confirmation but reset behavior depends on server implementation
- Some Blizzard global strings may not be localized in all languages
